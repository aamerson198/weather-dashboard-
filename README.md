This app works by utilizing the data compiled and stored in a third party API called Open Weather.

The user is able to enter the city for which they want to know the weather and they can then pull up a five day forecast that includes information like the UV Index, the temperature, and the humidity for that city.

The user should then be able to see a list of the cities that they've searched for in the past in locally stored history.
